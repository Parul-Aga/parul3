										<ul class="read-more-target" style="text-align:left">
											<li class="read-more-target">Do you find yourself in situations where it’s difficult for you to make choices that are in sync with your personal values?</li>
											<li class="read-more-target">Do you wonder how to share what’s important for you while also being considerate of the other person’s needs?</li>

</ul>
<h5 class="read-more-target">HOW DOES NON-VIOLENT COMMUNICATION HELP?</h5>
<p class="read-more-target">Nonviolent Communication (NVC) guides us to reframe the way we express ourselves and listen to others.
It invites us to focus our consciousness on four areas: what we observe, feel, need and request. It helps
us transform blame & judgment- where neither our own needs nor those of the other person are likely to be
met- into a space where mutually everyone’s needs matter. NVC encourages deep listening, respect, empathy
and creates a mutual desire to give from the heart. </p>
