				<p style="text-align:left"><i>Age group:</i> can be customized for middle and senior school students, as well as parents, adults in school settings, corporate settings, NGO’s, families or any other setting.
				Interactive workshop with games, activities (in pairs, small groups) and group discussions.
				Get in touch with me to conduct this workshop in your school, or in your workplace.</p>
														<ul  style="text-align:left">
															<li >Do you find yourself in situations where it’s difficult for you to make choices that are in sync with your personal values?</li>
															<li >Do you wonder how to share what’s important for you while also being considerate of the other person’s needs?</li>
															<li >Are you tired of hearing criticism and judgement and wish there was a better way to communicate?</li>
															<li >Do you wish to have deeper, meaningful interactions- at your workplace, in your personal life as well as in larger gatherings?</li>
				</ul>
				<h6 style="color:#f05d3c" >HOW DOES NON-VIOLENT COMMUNICATION HELP?</h6>
				<p style="text-align:left">Nonviolent Communication (NVC) guides us to reframe the way we express ourselves and listen to others.
				It invites us to focus our consciousness on four areas: what we observe, feel, need and request. It helps
				us transform blame & judgment- where neither our own needs nor those of the other person are likely to be
				met- into a space where mutually everyone’s needs matter. NVC encourages deep listening, respect, empathy
				and creates a mutual desire to give from the heart. </p>
