		 <h1>Parul Agarwal</h1>


		 <p>
			 I, Parul Agarwal, enjoy learning and working on myself through reflection exercises, community gatherings and conversations. I seek support when I sense that I need to be heard. I imagine creating enough spaciousness inside myself to be able to support a child, to nurture and care for one while also caring for myself. I am doing a small part of this now by caring for my grandmother.
			 <br><br>
			 I also make a conscious attempt to choose words that I use to express myself, both when speaking and writing. I recently discovered through my practice of Yoga and by noticing positive changes in my body that “Life is dynamic and I have the power to contribute to it’s dynamism”. This loving reminder helps me feel empowered to make choices, and act on them.
			 <br><br>
			 I’ve trained in Psychology through my college years and enjoyed it. My learning however grew immensely once I got introduced to Non-violent communication. It showed me that I can look at a client as a fellow human being and bring my whole self to connect with them, instead of holding a position of an expert, which separates me from them. It freed me from the fear of being a professional expert and being unable to express my needs as a fellow human. It showed me instead that I can openly express what’s alive in me as well, and can trust in my fellow human’s capacity to understand.
			 <br><br>
			 Through my own awareness and practices, I’ve begun to understand and see how I can support others and add value to people’s lives by being present for them, and helping them stay with their experience to see what emerges.
			 <br><br>
			 In my work so far, I’ve worked with hundreds of children, parents and individual adults, in groups and one-on-one. I’ve worked with schools and colleges, teaching Psychology; and as a Counsellor.
			 I would love to work with you too.
